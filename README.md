# **Spam Email Classifier**

## **Project Overview**
The Spam Email Classifier is a machine learning project designed to identify and filter out spam emails from a dataset. Using the Naive Bayes classifier, a probabilistic model that is particularly effective for text classification tasks, this project aims to accurately distinguish between spam and non-spam emails based on their content.

## **Features**
- **Spam Detection**: Classifies emails as spam or non-spam based on their content.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes a Naive Bayes algorithm, trained on a labeled dataset of emails.
- **Real-World Application**: The model is tested on real emails to ensure its effectiveness in a practical setting.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps like tokenization, stop-word removal, and feature extraction to prepare email text for classification.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn` for model creation and evaluation
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `nltk` for natural language processing tasks
  - `numpy` for numerical operations

## **Installation and Setup**
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-email-classifier.git
   cd spam-email-classifier
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Classifier**:
   ```bash
   python spam_classifier.py
   ```

## **Usage**
1. **Training the Model**: The model is trained using a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails. The Naive Bayes classifier is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in text classification tasks.
  
2. **Classifying Emails**: After training, the model can classify new emails as either spam or non-spam. Users can input email text, and the model will output a prediction.

3. **Testing and Evaluation**: The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable spam detection.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of labeled emails, typically with features such as:
- Email content (text)
- Label indicating whether the email is spam or non-spam

The dataset can be sourced from public datasets like the [Enron Email Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/) or similar.

## **Results**
The Spam Email Classifier achieved high accuracy in identifying spam emails, making it a useful tool for filtering unwanted messages in email systems. Detailed performance metrics and confusion matrices are provided in the results section of the code.
